All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The idea of computing the usage of array to adjust the capacity is very impressive to me. 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: In method capacityManagement, there is some repetition of some code, and it can be simplified.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Self-learning.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I had knew the circular way to build ArrayDeque, specifically.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Indeed, I wrote ArrayDeque again, rewrote many methods making it more elegant, such as removing tracking the endIndex, stop tracking the valid index of data array, and using a common way to process circle more efficiently.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Correct in one try. Wonderful time complexity.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The subsidiary node and the data node using the same class, so there is some memory space wasted, and kind of inelegent.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Nested class.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Using Nested class, making data node another good type.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Very like.
